Undersanding git is very tedious if you are new to it, but what can you do?

anyway im slowly making progress as i type this and ironic enough following all the steps on what to do is more confusing than the actual task head

typing like an idiot in here for now, will update this to keep track of my progress.

Alright done with the first project, like a said though all the tedious git commands takes longer to do than the actual project so far. It will probably be the oposite in the future.
